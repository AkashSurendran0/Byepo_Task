# Multi-Tenant Feature Flag Management System

A SaaS-style multi-tenant feature flag management system built as part of the Byepo Technologies Pragmatist Technical Assessment.

## Overview

This application allows:

- **Super Admins** to create and manage organizations.
- **Organization Admins** to manage feature flags for their own organizations.
- **End Users** to check whether a particular feature is enabled for their organization.

The project follows a layered architecture with Dependency Inversion using **InversifyJS**.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- TypeScript
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- JWT Authentication
- bcrypt
- InversifyJS

---

## Architecture

The backend follows:

```text
Request
↓
Controller
↓
Use Case Interface
↓
Use Case Implementation
↓
Repository Interface
↓
Repository Implementation
↓
MongoDB
```

Business logic is separated from controllers to maintain clean architecture and follow the Dependency Inversion Principle.

# Authentication

### Super Admin

Uses static credentials configured inside the backend.

### Organization Admin & End Users

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
- JWT is used for authentication.

---

# Assumptions

- Multiple Organization Admins can belong to the same organization.
- End Users are associated with a single organization.
- Feature checks are performed using the authenticated user's organization.
